## :pencil: About The Project

MeetCode is a real-time mock technical interview platform designed to simulate the high-pressure environment of technical interviews. Through live pair programming sessions, users engage with an AI interviewer that challenges them with coding problems, asks in-depth questions about time complexity and algorithm improvements, and provides immediate feedback based on their performance.

Key aspects of the project include:
- **Interactive Interview Sessions:** Simulated interviews with real-time audio and code interactions.
- **Live Coding Environment:** A fully featured code editor that supports code compilation and custom test cases.
- **Audio Transcription & Voice Simulation:** Integrated with the OpenAI API for realistic voice interactions and transcription, ensuring the conversation context is maintained.

## :fork_and_knife: Tech Stack

MeetCode is built with a modern, scalable web stack:
- **Frontend:** React / Next.js, styled with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.
- **Database:** MongoDB, Redis.
- **APIs:** OpenAI API for voice simulation and ElevenLabs transcription.

## :floppy_disk: Data Source

The platform leverages a curated LeetCode problem dataset to generate interview challenges. Explore the dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gzipchrist/leetcode-problem-dataset).

âœ¤ This project was developed as a comprehensive simulation platform to help users practice coding, problem-solving, and interview communication in a realistic environment.
